# Proposal: add booleans as non-figure types in Euclid

Add operators:

* `not`
* `or`
* `xor`
* `not`

Add constants:

* `true`
* `false`

## Pros

* Conditional expressions become more readable and easier to use.

## Cons

* Another non-figure type must be implemented, adding complexity to Euclid.

## Alternatives

* Use reals as booleans
