# Proposal: add a complete real arithmetic system to Euclid

Real numbers can be used in any construction.

Add the following operators:
* \+
* \-
* I'll add more later

### Pros

Real arithmetic would make Euclid easier to use. Adding real arithmetic does not complicate Euclid from the user's perspective.
The use of real numbers also allows for other useful language features, such as a sophisticated tuple system.

### Cons

The use of real numbers can be abused. Real numbers make Euclid more complicated from the implementer's perspective.
