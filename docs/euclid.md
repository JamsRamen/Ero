# Euclid

Euclid is a functional scripting language intended to describe and render Euclidean constructions in two or three dimensions. The Euclid language is inspired by _Elements_, an ancient geometry textbook by Euclid of Alexandria. As a result, the Euclid language barely uses arithmetic, relying on geometry as its main method of computation. Euclid is Turing complete (able to compute anything which is computable) and Euclid complete (able to construct any Euclidean construction) despite being built on four basic constructions (called "postulates") and a simple syntax.

### The Four Postulates

Let the following be postulated:
1. To describe a plane given three points not on one line,
1. To describe a sphere given a center and a point on that sphere,
1. To describe the intersection of two given figures,
1. To select a point on a given figure.
