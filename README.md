# Ero

Ero is a functional scripting language intended to describe and process Euclidean constructions in two or three dimensions. Ero is inspired by _Elements_, an ancient geometry textbook by Euclid of Alexandria. As a result, Ero does not focus on algebra or arithmetic. Rather, it relies on geometry as its main method of computation, even though real arithmetic is still supported. Ero is Turing complete (able to compute anything which is computable) and Euclid complete (able to construct any Euclidean construction). Ero can also be used to create non-Euclidean constructions (such as an angle trisection and squaring the circle).

## About the Name

"Ero" (pronounced like "arrow") was the name chosen for this language purely because it was short, memorable, and not already taken. Whether or not there is a deeper significance to this name is left as an excercise to the user.
